# Dynamic-Trust-Aware-Capsule

### 🔐 **Custom Encrypted Container Format ("Capsule")**

* Treating the capsule like a secure, dynamic ZIP-like format is solid.
* App-locked encryption/decryption ensures tight control.
* Auto-encryption on close + shredding on expiry builds **zero-trust** behavior into the file format.

### 🏛️ **Three-Tiered Architecture**

1. **Client App** (user-side): opens/edits capsule, decrypts locally with secure app keys
2. **Admin Control App**: creates/revokes capsules, sets expiry, monitors use
3. **Central Control Server**: validates permissions, synchronizes metadata, audits operations

### 🗃️ **Data Stores**

* **PostgreSQL** for users, admins, capsule metadata, tokens = great for RBAC & strict consistency.
* **MongoDB** for log aggregation = scalable, flexible, great for analytics.
* **Encrypted Capsule Files** = stored on disk/S3 with AES-256 and fingerprint-based control.

## 🔍 Suggestions & Architecture Refinements

### 1. **Capsule Format (Custom Encrypted Container)**

Use this layered model:

```plaintext
[CPSX Capsule File]
├── manifest.json   <-- Metadata: creator, expiry, access level
├── contents/       <-- Actual encrypted files
├── rules.json      <-- Inline policy
└── checksum.sig    <-- Integrity + signature
```

* AES-256-GCM for content encryption
* Public/private key for manifest signing (authenticity)
* Policy engine inside `rules.json` (like JSON Logic or OPA-wasm rules)

### 2. **App-Locked Encryption (Decryption Guardrail)**

* Use app-bound **key derivation** (e.g., derived via app fingerprint + user token).
* Embed capsule decryption in client runtime + force policy checks from **Central Server**.
* Use **Secure Enclave / TPM / Trusted Execution** to prevent exfiltration.

### 3. **Central Control Service (Highly Critical)**

* Handles token validation, TTL expiry, revocation sync
* All capsule actions (open, access, expire) should **request a temporary access lease**
* Implement rate-limiting, session-tied keys, revoke-on-command feature

### 4. **Capsule Shredding**

* At capsule open: register ephemeral token with TTL
* On close or expiry: overwrite + securely wipe disk (OS dependent)
* Keep shredding metadata in MongoDB: `capsule_id`, `shredded_at`, `reason`, `actor`

## 💾 Storage & Deployment Considerations

| Component              | Tech Recommendation                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Capsule File System    | Local FS + optional S3 with envelope encryption |
| Central Control Server | Node.js (API) + gRPC for fast checks            |
| Policy Evaluator       | OPA (Open Policy Agent) embedded in WASM        |
| Auth/Access Tokens     | OAuth2 / JWT + PKCE                             |
| Logging + Analytics    | MongoDB + optional ELK stack                    |
| User DB                | PostgreSQL (with UUIDs, RLS, audit trail)       |

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* All capsules should be **signed** and **versioned** to prevent tampering.
* Validate all rules **server-side** even if client enforces them.
* Logs (especially shredding events) should be immutable (append-only Mongo or blockchain if critical).
* Add **Capsule Access Replay Protection** (once-decrypted, invalidate local key unless re-verified).

---

## 📈 Future Scalability Ideas

* Add **geo-fencing or geo-lock** in capsule policy (e.g., can only open in India)
* Implement **air-gapped capsule unlock** via QR + OTP
* Use **blockchain** for high-trust capsule registry
* Capsule **expiration reminders**, **revocation workflows**, and **download tracking**

## 🧠 TL;DR (Advice Summary)

| Aspect          | Verdict                         | Notes                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture    | ✅ Strong                        | Modular + secure. Make Central Server the trust core.      |
| Capsule Concept | ✅ Novel + Practical             | Ensure encryption is tight and policies can't be bypassed. |
| Logs & Audits   | ✅ Smart use of MongoDB          | Keep write-only logs for compliance.                       |
| Risk Areas      | ⚠️ Key Leakage, OS-level access | Consider Secure Enclave, ephemeral keys, disk wiping.      |
| MVP Feasibility | ✅ Buildable in 6–10 weeks       | Start with basic capsule rules, expand later.              |

Would you like me to generate a sample `.capsule` manifest format or set up the folder structure and encryption module for this system?
